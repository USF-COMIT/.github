## Who are we

> The benefits of the Center for Ocean Mapping and Innovative Technologies are intended for a diverse community of constituencies by developing, testing and implementing better, cheaper and faster approaches to ocean and coastal mapping. Innovative approaches developed under this Center will serve a wide variety of constituencies, stake holder groups, and the public with more precise, timely and informative ocean and coastal mapping products.
The Centerâ€™s outputs will meet a variety of needs such as navigational safety as well as better understanding the spatial distribution of essential fish habitat. The technological developments planned for COMIT also seek to provide rapid response tools to re-map critical navigational areas during coastal disasters.
